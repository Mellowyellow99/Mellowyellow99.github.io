## Reflecting on Past Professional Experience

During my junior year of college, which was from the Fall 2019 to Spring 2020, I would for the Resource Recovery program at the University of Texas (UT). I was an intern for both their zero waste events and waste audit teams. After a semester of working there, my title was promoted to "Zero Waste Events Specialist". As someone who desires to spend their life working in the fields of conservation and sustainability, I cannot stress enough how grateful I am for the growth that this internship provided me.

### Zero Waste Events Team

When I joined the Resource Recovery program, the Zero Waste Events team was brand new, so a fellow co-lead and I were in charge of heading it from scratch. Both my written and verbal communication skills were drastically improved because this position required me to complete the following tasks: sending persuasive emails to faculty and staff event planners to encourage them to opt for hosting a zero waste event, leading meetings with higher-level university employees, and creating informative visuals (e.g. infographics and PowerPoints) to educate people on the sustainable efforts being made around campus. As a result, I am able to confidently and independently communicate with a diverse range of people in a clear, positive, and effective manner, while maintaining a mutual level of respect. I have great interpersonal skills and am able to read social situations extremely well, which is why I excel in various types of professional environments. 

I am also really good at engaging with local communities because of my strong passion for environmental education and community outreach. One of the things that I have valued the most regarding my internship with UT Resource Recovery is how it has allowed me to spread my knowledge of sustainability across campus. It is my personal belief that knowledge is wasted if not shared with those around you. This is important because conservation and sustainability efforts require a united force; thus, there must be people like me on project teams that are able to motivate and educate large groups of people.

### Waste Audit Team
As a part of the Waste Audit team, I gained valuable experiences in data collection, resource management, and communication. Alongside of my fellow coworkers, I routinely completed waste audits of the campus material streams (landfill, recycling, and compost) and analyzed the data to see where our team should be targeting our waste diversion efforts. In doing so, not only did I drastically improve my research skills but I also learned how to remain a positive and focused worker even in harsh conditions. I am familiar with following proper safety protocol and I am able to keep team members motivated even with the intense temperatures and thunderstorms that central Texas can face. Furthermore, this job opened my eyes to the fact that I really enjoy working hands-on, research based jobs!
