My sophomore year of college, I was enrolled in a course called "Communicating Sustainability," which required me to complete the group project located below. For this project, a couple of classmates and I created a fake marketing agency called "GRAMS". Our goal was to explore the benefits of community farming, in the hopes that we could better market Microfarm, which is a community farm run by students at the University of Texas. (If you have any additional questions on this project, please feel free to email me.)
