      <description>Let&#39;s talk about Pyhton and Rstudio In the Fall of 2020, I took a course called &amp;quot;Computational Biology and Bioinformatics&amp;quot; at the University of Texas, in which I learned how to navigate Rstudio and Python programming languages. What I found super interesting about these resources is that they aren&#39;t mutually exclusive and that you can actually use them both together! The two coding projects that are located in the &amp;quot;Projects&#39;&#39; tab of this website were completed solely using Rstudio; however, in this post I will show you how one can pull a file from Rstudio and complete Python functions using it.</description>

      <description>UT Resource Recovery   Reflecting on Past Professional Experience During my junior year of college, which was from the Fall 2019 to Spring 2020, I would for the Resource Recovery program at the University of Texas (UT). I was an intern for both their zero waste events and waste audit teams. After a semester of working there, my title was promoted to &amp;quot;Zero Waste Events Specialist&amp;quot;. As someone who desires to spend their life working in the fields of conservation and sustainability, I cannot stress enough how grateful I am for the growth that this internship provided me.</description>
